(A very long silence.)
– But you have friends.
(A long silence.)
You have a lot of friends.
What do you offer your friends to make them so supportive?

 What do you offer your friends to make them so supportive?

a consolidated consciousness resides in a darkened banqueting hall
near the ceiling of a mind whose floor shifts as ten thousand
cockroaches when a shaft of light enters as all thoughts unite in an
instant of accord body no longer expellent as the cockroaches
comprise a truth which no one ever utters
I had a night in which everything was revealed to me.
How can I speak again?
the broken hermaphrodite who trusted hermself alone finds the room
in reality teeming and begs never to wake from the nightmare
and they were all there
every last one of them
and they knew my name
as I scuttled like a beetle along the backs of their chairs
Remember the light and believe the light
An instant of clarity before eternal night
don't let me forget
I am sad
I feel that the future is hopeless and that things cannot improve
I am bored and dissatisfied with everything
I am a complete failure as a person
I am guilty, I am being punished
I would like to kill myself
I used to be able to cry but now I am beyond tears
I have lost interest in other people
I can't make decisions
I can't eat
I can't sleep
I can't think
I cannot overcome my loneliness, my fear, my disgust
I am fat
I cannot write
I cannot love
My brother is dying, my lover is dying, I am killing them both
I am charging towards my death
I am terrified of medication
I cannot make love
I cannot fuck
I cannot be alone
I cannot be with others
My hips are too big
I dislike my genitals
At 4.48
when depression visits
I shall hang myself
to the sound of my lover's breathing
I do not want to die
I have become so depressed by the fact of my mortality that I have
decided to commit suicide
I do not want to live
I am jealous of my sleeping lover and cover his induced
unconsciousness
When he wakes he will envy my sleepless night of thought and
speech unslurred by medication
I have resigned myself to death this year
Some will call this self-indulgence
(they are lucky not to know its truth)
Some will know the simple fact of pain
This is becoming my normality

It wasn't for long, I wasn't there long. But drinking bitter black coffee I
catch that medicinal smell in a cloud of ancient tobacco and something
touches me in that still place and a wound form two years ago opens
like a cadaver and a long buried shame roars its foul decaying grief.
A room of expressionless faces string blankly at my pain, so
devoid of meaning there must be evil intent.
Dr This and Dr That and Dr Whatsit who's just passing and
thought he'd pop in to take the piss as well. Burning in a hot
tunnel of dismay, my humiliation complete as I shake without
reason and stumble over words and have nothing to say about
my 'illness' which anyway amounts only to knowing that there's
no point in anything because I'm going to die. And I am
deadlocked by that smooth psychiatric voice of reason which
tells me there is an objective reality in which my body and mind
are one. But I am not here and never have been. Dr This writes it
down and Dr That attempts a sympathetic murmur. Watching
me, judging me, smelling the crippling failure oozing from my
skin, my desperation clawing and all-consuming panic
drenching me as I gape in horror at the world and wonder why
everyone is smiling and looking at me with secret knowledge of
my aching shame.
Shame shame shame.
Drown in your fucking shame.
Inscrutable doctors, sensible doctors, way-out doctors, doctors
you'd think were fucking patients if you weren't shown proof
otherwise, ask the same questions, put words in my mouth, offer
chemical cures for congenital anguish and cover each other's
arses until I want to scream for you, the only doctor who ever
touched me voluntarily, who looked me in the eye, who laughed
at my gallows humour spoken in the voice from the newly-dug
grave, who took the piss when I shaved my head, who lied and
said it was nice to see me. Who lied. And said it was nice to see
me. I trusted you, I loved you, and it's not losing you that hurts
me, but your bare-faced fucking falsehoods that masquerade as
medical notes.
Your truth, your lies, not mine.
And while I was believing that you were different and that you
maybe even felt the distress that sometimes flickered across
your face and threatened to erupt, you were covering your arse
too. Like every othoer stupid mortal cunt.
To my mind that's betrayal. And my mind is the subject of these
bewildered fragments.
Nothing can extinguish my anger.
And nothing can restore my faith.
This is not a world in which I wish to live.
–Have you made any plans?
–Take an overdose, slash my wrists then hang myself.
–All those things together?
–It couldn't possibly be misconstrued as a cry for help.
(Silence.)
–It wouldn't work.
–Of course it would.
–It wouldn't work. You'd start to feel sleepy from the overdose
and wouldn't have the energy to cut your wrists.
(Silence.)
–I'd be standing on a chair with a noose around my neck.
(Silence.)
– If you were alone do you think you might harm yourself?
–I'm scared I might.
–Could that be protective?
–Yes. It's fear that keeps me away from the train tracks. I just
hope to God that death is the fucking end. I feel like I'm eighty
years old. I'm tired of life and my mind wants to die.
–That's a metaphor, not reality.
–It's a simile.
–That's not reality.
–It's not a metaphor, it's a simile, but even if it were, the defining
feature of a metaphor is that it's real.
(A long silence.)
–You are not eighty years old.
(Silence.)
Are you?
(A silence.)
Are you?
(A silence.)
Or are you?
(A long silence.)
–Do you despise all unhappy people or is it me specifically?
–I don't despise you. It's not your fault. You're ill.
–I don't think so.
–No?
–No. I'm depressed. Depression is anger. It's what you did, who
was there and who you're blaming.
–And who are you blaming?
–Myself.
Body and soul can never be married
I need to become who I already am and will bellow forever at this
incongruity which has committed me to hell
Insoluble hoping cannot uphold me
I will drown in dysphoria
in the cold black pond of my self
the pit of my immaterial mind
How can I return to form
now my formal thought has gone?
Not a life that I could countenance.
They will love me for that which destroys me
the sword in my dreams
the dust of my thoughts
the sickness that breeds in the folds of my mind
Every compliment takes a piece of my soul
An expressionist nag
Stalling between two fools
They know nothing –
 I have always walked free
Last in a long line of literary kleptomaniacs
(a time honoured tradition)
Theft is the holy act
On a twisted path to expression
A glut of exclamation marks spells impending nervous breakdown
Just a word on a page and there is the drama
I write for the dead
the unborn
After 4.48 I shall not speak again
I have reached the end of his dreary and repugnant tale of a sense interned
in an alien carcass and lumpen by the malignant spirit of the moral
majority
I have been dead for a long time
Back to my roots
I sing without hope on the boundary
RSVP ASAP
Sometimes I turn around and catch the smell of you and I cannot go on
I cannot fucking go on without expressing this terrible so fucking awful
physical aching fucking longing I have for you. And I cannot believe
that I can feel this for you and you feel nothing. Do you feel nothing?
(Silence.)
And I go out at six in the morning and start my search for you. If I've
dreamt a message of a street or a pub or a station I go there. And I wait
for you.
(Silence.)
You know, I really feel like I'm being manipulated.
(Silence.)
I've never in my life had a problem giving another person what they
want. But no one's ever been able to do that for me. No one touches me,
no one gets near me. But now you've touched me somewhere so fucking
deep I can't believe and I can't be that for you. Because I can't find you.
(Silence.)
What does she look like?
And how will I know her when I see her?
She'll die, she'll die, she'll only fucking die.
(Silence.)
Do you think it's possible for a person to be born in the wrong body?
(Silence.)
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you for rejecting me by never being there,
fuck you for making me feel shit about myself, fuck you for bleeding
the fucking love and life out of me, fuck my father for fucking up my
life for good and fuck my mother for not leaving him, but most of all,
fuck you God for making me love a person who does not exist,
FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU.
–Oh dear, what's happened to your arm?
–I cut it.
–That's a very immature, attention seeking thing to do. Did it give
you relief?
–No.
–Did it relieve the tension?
–No.
–Did it give you relief?
(Silence.)
Did it give you relief?
–No.
–I don't understand why you did that.
–Than ask.
–Did it relieve the tension?
(A long silence.)
Can I look?
–No.
–I'd like to look, to see if it's infected.
–No.
(Silence.)
–I thought you might do this. Lots of people do. It relieves the
tension.
–Have you ever done it?
–...
–No. Far too fucking sane and sensible. I don't know where you
read that, but it does not relieve the tension.
(Silence.)
Why don't you ask me why?
Why did I cut my arm?
–Would you like to tell me?
–Yes.
- Then tell me.
–ASK.
ME.
WHY.
(A long silence.)
–Why did you cut your arm?
–Because it feels fucking great. Because it feels fucking amazing.
– Can I look?
–You can look. But don't touch.
–(Looks) And you don't think you're ill?
– No.
–I do. It's not your fault. But you have to take responsibility for
your own actions. Please don't do it again.
I dread the loss of her I've never touched
love keeps me a slave in a cage of tears
I gnaw my tongue with which to her I can never speak
I miss a woman who was never born
I kiss a woman across the years that say we shall never meet
 Everything passes
 Everything perishes
 Everything palls
my thought walks away with a killing smile
leaving discordant anxiety
which roars in my soul
No hope No hope No hope No hope No hope No hope No hope
A song for my loved one, touching her absence
the flux of her heart, the splash of her smile
In ten years time she'll still be dead. When I'm living with it, dealing
with it, when a few days pass when I don't even think of it, she'll still
be dead. When I'm an old lady living ion the street forgetting my
name she'll still be dead, she'll still be dead, she'll still be dead, it's
just
fucking
over
and I must stand alone
My love, my love, why have you forsaken me?
She is the couching place where I never shall lie
and there's no meaning to life in the light of my loss
Built to be lonely
to love the absent
Find me
Free me
from this
corrosive doubt
futile despair
horror in repose
I can fill my space
fill my time
but nothing can fill this void in my heart
The vital need for which I would die
Breakdown
–No ifs or buts.
–I didn't say if or but, I said no.
–Can't must never have-to always won't should shan't.
The unnegotiables
Not today.
(Silence.)
–Please. Don't switch off my mind by attempting to straighten me
out. Listen and understand, and when you feel contempt don't
express it, at least not verbally, at least not to me.
(Silence.)
–I don't feel contempt.
–No?
–No. It's not your fault.
–It's not your fault, that's all I ever hear, it's not your fault, it's an
illness, it's not your fault, I know it's not my fault. You've told
me that so often I'm beginning to think it is my fault.
–It's not your fault.
–I KNOW.
–But you allow it.
(Silence.)
Don't you?
–There's not a drug on earth can make life meaningful.
–You allow this state of desperate absurdity.
(Silence.)
You allow it.
(Silence.)
–I won't be able to think. I won't be able to work.
–Nothing will interfere with your work like suicide.
(Silence.)
–I dreamt I went to the doctor's and she gave me eight minutes to
live. I'd been sitting in the fucking waiting room half an hour.
(A long silence.)
Okay, let's do it, let's do the drugs, let's do the chemical
lobotomy, let's shut down the higher functions of my brain and
perhaps I'll be a bit more fucking capable of living.
Let's do it.

A dotted line on the throat
CUT HERE
DON'T LET THIS KILL ME
THIS WILL KILL ME AND CRUSH ME AND
SEND ME TO HELL
I beg you to save me from this madness that eats me
a sub-intentional death
I thought I should never speak again
but now I know there is something blacker than desire
perhaps it will save me
perhaps it will kill me
a dismal whistle that is the cry of heartbreak around the hellish
bowl at the ceiling of my mind
a blanket of roaches
cease this war
My legs are empty
Nothing to say
And there is the rhythm of madness
–I gassed the Jews, I killed the Kurds, I bombed the Arabs, I
fucked small children while they begged for mercy, the killing
fields are mine, everyone left the party because of me, I'll suck
your fucking eyes out sent them to your mother in a box and
when I die I'm going to be reincarnated as your child only fifty
times worse and as mad as all fuck I'm going to make your life a
living fucking hell I REFUSE I REFUSE I REFUSE LOOK
AWAY FROM ME
–It's all right.
–LOOK AWAY FROM ME
–It's all right. I'm here.
–Look away from me
Why am I stricken?
I saw visions of God
and it shall come to pass
Grid yourselves:
for ye shall be broken in pieces
it shall come to pass
Behold the light of despair
the glare of anguish
and ye shall be driven to darkness
If there is blasting
(there shall be blasting)
the names of offenders shall be shouted form the rooftops
Fear God
and his wicked convocation
a scall on my skin, a seethe in my heart
a blanket of roaches on which we dance
this infernal state of siege
All this shall come to pass
all the words of my noisome breath
Remember the light and believe the light
Christ is dead
and the monks are in ecstasy
We are the abjects
who depose our leaders
and burn incense unto Baal
Come now, let us reason together
Sanity is found in the mountain of the Lord's house on the
horizon of the soul that eternally recedes
The head is sick, the heart's caul torn
Thread the ground on which wisdom walks
Embrace beautiful lies –
the chronic insanity of the sane
the wrenching begins
–At 4.48
when sanity visits
for one hour and twelve minutes I am in my right mind.
When it has passed I shall be gone again,
a fragmented puppet, a grotesque fool.
Now I am here I can see myself
but when I am charmed by vile delusions of happiness,
the foul magic of this engine of sorcery,
I cannot touch my essential self.
Why do you believe me then and now?
 Remember the light and believe the light.
Nothing matters more.
Stop judging by appearances and make a right judgement.
–It's all right. You will get better.
–Your disbelief cures nothing.
Look away from me.

Sanity is found at the centre of convulsion, where madness is scorched
form the bisected soul.
I know myself.
I see myself.
My life is caught in a web of reason
spun by a doctor to argument the sane.
At 4.48
I shall sleep
I came to you hoping to be healed.
You are my doctor, my saviour, my omnipotent judge, my priest, my
god, the surgeon of my soul.
And I am your proselyte to sanity.

–You've seen the worst of me.
–Yes.
–I know nothing of you.
–No.
–But I like you.
–I like you
(Silence.)
–You're my last hope.
(A long silence.)
–You don't need a friend you need a doctor.
(A long silence.)
–You are so wrong.
(A very long silence.)
–But you have friends.
(A long silence.)
You have a lot of friends.
What do you offer your friends to make them so supportive?
(A long silence.)
What do you offer your friends to make them so supportive?
(A long silence.)
What do you offer?
(Silence.)
We have a professional relationship. I think we have a good
relationship. But it's professional.
(Silence.)
I feel your pain but I cannot hold your life in my hands.
(Silence.)
You'll be all right. You're strong. I know you'll be okay because I
like you and you can't like someone who doesn't like themself.
The people I fear for are the ones I don't like because they hate
themselves so much they won't let anyone else like them either.
But I do like you. I'll miss you. And I know you'll be ok.
(Silence.)
Most of my clients want to kill me. When I walk out of here at the
end of the day I need to go home to my lover and relax. I need to
be with my friends and relax. I need my friends to be really
together.
(Silence.)
I fucking hate this job and I need my friends to be sane.
(Silence.)
I'm sorry.
–It's not my fault.
–I'm sorry, that was a mistake.
–It's not my fault.
–No. It's not your fault. I'm sorry.
(Silence.)
I was trying to explain –
–I know. I'm angry because I understand, not because I don't.
Fattened up
 Shored up
 Shoved up
my body decompensates
my body flies apart
no way to reach out
beyond the reaching out I've already done
you will always have a piece of me
because you held my life in your hands
those brutal hands
this will end me
I thought it was silent
till it went silent
how have you inspired this pain?
I've never understood
what it is I'm not supposed to feel
like a bird on the wing in a swollen sky
my mind is torn by lightning
as it flies form the thunder behind

Stark light

Nothing

What am I like?
the child of negation
out of one torture chamber into another
a vile succession of errors without remission
every step of the way I've fallen
Despair propels me to suicide
Anguish for which doctors can find no cure
Nor care to understand
I hope you never understand
Because I like you
I like you
I like you
still black water
as deep as forever
as cold as the sky
as still as my heart when your voice is gone
I shall freeze in hell
of course I love you
you saved my life
I wish you hadn't
I wish you hadn't
I wish you'd left me alone
a black and white film of yes or no yes or no yes or no yes or no yes or no yes
or no
I've always loved you
even when I hated you
What am I like?
just like my father

the rupture begins
I don't know where to look anymore
Tired of crowd searching
 Telepathy
and hope
Watch the stars
predict the past
and change the world with a silver eclipse
the only thing that's permanent is destruction
we're all going to disappear
trying to leave a mark more permanent that myself
I've not killed myself before so don't look for precedents
What came before was just the beginning
a cyclical fear
that's not the moon it's the earth
A revolution
Dear God, dear God, what shall I do?
All I know
is snow
 and black despair
Nowhere left to turn
an ineffectual mortal spasm
the only alternative to murder
Please don't cut me up to find out how I died
I'll tell you how I died
One hundred Lofepramine, forty five Zopiclone, twenty five
Temazepam, and twenty Melleril
Everything I had
Swallowed
Slit
Hung
It is done
behold the Eunuch
of castrated thought
skull
unwound
the capture
 the rapture
 the rupture
 of a soul
a solo symphony
warm darkness
which soaks my eyes
I know no sin
this is the sickness of becoming great
 the vital need for which I would die
 to be loved
I'm dying for one who doesn't care
I'm dying for one who doesn't know
 you're breaking me
Speak
Speak
Speak
ten yard ring of failure
look away from me
My final stand
No one speaks
Validate me
Witness me
See me
Love me
my final submission
my final defeat
the chicken's still dancing
the chicken won't stop
I think that you think of me
the way I'd have you think of me
the final period
the final full stop
look after your mum now
look after your mum
Black snow falls
in death you hold me
 never free
I have no desire for death
no suicide ever had
watch me vanish
watch me
vanish
watch me
watch me
watch
It is myself I have never met, whose face is pasted on the underside of my mind
please open the curtains
